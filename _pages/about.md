Hello! I am a 4th-year PhD candidate at the [European Molecular Biology Laboratory](https://www.embl.de) working in the [Crocker lab](https://www.embl.de/research/units/dev_biology/crocker/index.html). My PhD Thesis focuses on questions about enhancer and cis-regulatory module (CRM) evolvability such as: 

- How much regulatory information is encoded within a developmental enhancer? 
- How do cis-regulatory mutations create novel phenotypes? 
- How does enhancer regulatory logic create developmental biases and constrain evolvability? 

To answer these questions, we are developing and improving technologies in biochemistry, image acquisition, and image registration to mutationally-scan cis-regulatory elements. This means we build robots (**Arduino**) and write codes (**FIJI**, **Python**) for our microscopes and computers to see how DNA regulatory sequences can and cannot evolve patterns of gene expression.

You may bump into me into me on a wall at the bouldering gym, swimming laps at the local pool, out training for another marathon (Berlin Marathon 2021), or riding my bike up and down to the lab. For me, creativity is an essential mechanism for constructing and formulating concrete ideas. Before I became a scientist, I studied clarinet performance and you may still hear me playing the clarinet with the local Blasmusikverein. I also do quite a bit of art, which you can find [here](https://tfuqua95.github.io/art/) if you're interested.
